                  <p>
                    Front end is all about the look and feel of your website. It it how a user interacts and navigates the physical space of your application or website. A developer who specializes in front end tecnhologies will be able to help you with your design and website construction needs. They can also help with animations and effects on your project as well.

                  <p className="service-title">Back End Technologies</p>
                  <p>
                    The back end is all about data. Developers who specialize in back end technologies will help you sort out of your data needs. If you need new website routes, a database setup, data management, API consturction, or anything else related to data you want a back end developer.

                  <p>
                    Full stack developers are the swiss army knife of web dev. They are familiar with both front end and back end technologies and can help in many different facets of a project. When designing a website with data storage needs, one full stack developer could be your answer instead of two seperate deverlopers.
